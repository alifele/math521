# MATH521 - Numerical Analysis of PDE

This git repository contains some course materials for `MATH521 - Numerical Analysis of PDE`, taught at UBC, by C Ortner. 

- All materials are provided as Julia scripts. To install Julia, follow the instructions at [https://julialang.org](https://julialang.org). I suggest to use at least Julia 1.9, but better 1.10. 
- Read the [Get Started](https://julialang.org/learning/getting-started/) pages. 
- Clone this `git` repository to your local computer. If you don't know how to use git and don't want to learn it, then you can also just download the individual files.
